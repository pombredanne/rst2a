About
=====

``rst2pdf`` is an application for converting reStructuredText_ documents to PDF
files. It exports a command-line interface for file conversion, with several
options for customising output, including reST document options and LaTeX
stylesheets.

Libraries Used
==============

``rst2pdf`` uses several third-party libraries and applications to convert reST 
to PDF. These are:

    * Docutils (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/)
    * The Python Imaging Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
    * ``pdflatex`` (http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/)

Usage
=====

``rst2pdf`` is used primarily as a command line application. For the most basic
usage, it should be given a stylesheet, an input file and an output file. The
stylesheet should be in TeX format, as it will be used for converting the reST
document to LaTeX, which is the first half of the reST-to-PDF pipeline. A
typical case usage looks like this::

    rst2pdf --stylesheet style.tex input.rst output.pdf

In addition, a document class may also be specified. This will affect the
eventual layout of the resulting PDF document. The class may be one of:

    * article
    * book
    * report
    * scrarticle (screen article)
    * scrbook (screen book)
    * scrreport (screen report)

A class is specified using the ``--class`` option. So::

    rst2pdf --stylesheet style.tex --class book input.rst output.pdf
    
Will render a 'book' style PDF file from ``input.rst``.

``rst2pdf`` As a Python Module
==============================

``rst2pdf`` also functions as a Python module. It exports several classes and   
functions which are used in the reST-to-PDF pipeline. More information on these
may be found in the docstrings for the ``rst2pdf`` module, and the individual
classes. Also, developers may want to take a look at the extensive comments in
the ``rst2pdf`` file.
